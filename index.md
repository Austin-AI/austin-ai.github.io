Artificial Intelligence (AI) is potentially one of the most transformative technologies in human history—and may have impact that exceeds even the Internet and web, laptop and smartphones, and supercomputers. AI is poised to reshape mobility, healthcare, industry, government, safety, national security, and more. However, the new wave of AI—machine learning and especially deep learning—is complex and evolving rapidly, requires new hardware and software for maximum performance, and faces challenges in adoption and measurement of ROI, explainability and forensic analysis, and bias and other ethical issues. Nonetheless, AI is deemed by many innovators, researchers, business leaders, and more as being the most revolutionary (and by a few, potentially dangerous) technology of our time.

Austin is one of the leading technology cities in the world. We are the home of major offices and/or headquarters for technology giants investing in AI including Dell, IBM, AMD, Arm, Nvidia, Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and more, as well as The University of Texas at Austin. We have a creative, dynamic entrepreneurial culture and active startup scene, and are now home to many data- and AI-focused companies such CognitiveScale, data.world, Valkyrie Intelligence, Hypergiant, SparkCognition, Kungfu.AI, Molecula, and more. Our companies and universities AI innovations and offerings span hardware, software, services, research, and education. We are also home to many companies (across verticals), government agencies (civilian and military), and education organizations who are using and/or need to adopt AI. Austin is not yet, however, one of the world’s leading AI cities.

Accelerating efforts and to become a world leading AI city in the globally competitive landscape of AI—from innovation to application to education—will require coordinated collaboration as an ecosystem, not just individual efforts. Furthermore, we can promote Austin to leadership by focusing not only on AI technology innovation, but also on the numerous business, security, and societal applications and impacts AI is projected to have—and this also requires collaboration across the ecosystem. Thus, the objective of this second Austin AI Ecosystem Initiative meetup is to establish a charter and an organization that enables the Austin AI ecosystem members to collaborate wherever it helps us all. The first open meeting (Oct 9, 2019) brought parties together to share their interests in AI. Since then, we have considered the inputs, monitored the AI landscape, and discussed the Austin opportunities.

We now have an outline for the AI Ecosystem

what our vision and objectives should be
how we should organize
what potential projects and funding sources we could pursue to achieve this vision and objectives.
Join us as we hear speakers from leading AI companies, the City of Austin, and businesses and government organizations who use AI share examples from the ecosystem. Then, we will share a draft of a vision, objectives, roadmap for building a collaborative ecosystem effort, and a program of activities to achieve the objectives.
